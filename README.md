# xG-Model-World-Cup-2018
# Introduction
xG models or expected goal models are one of the most popular models that data scientists/analysts are currently trying to perfect using machine learning in the soccer industry. For each opportunity in the beautiful game of soccer, the model will determine if there would be a goal or not (for decision tree-models) or even an accurate numeric value (regression models) using other useful data (for eg: angle of shot, distance to goal, right foot or left foot, etc). I will be using a decision tree-model for this model.

# Data - World Cup 2018
The dataset I will be using will be from the 2018 World Cup from statsbomb.com. This consist of shots, goals, x and y distance to goal, deflected goals, whether the shot is a first time shot, play pattern, amount of pressure, a one on one situation, and other kinds of information to determine if this opportunity would be a goal.

# Feature engineering
To improve accuracy of the model, it is best to combine multiple variables to something that would make more sense. For example, instead of using the raw data of x distance and y distance away from goal seperately, it would be better to use the distance formula, a new variable, for accuracy.

# Train the model
Split the data into a training and test set.

# Evaluate the model
Show results and determine if our model was accurate in identifying goals or no goals properly.
